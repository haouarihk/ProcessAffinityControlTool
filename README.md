PACT is a tool designed to give you a tighter control over your system by selecting which programs runs on which core.

It has a multi-tier system:
    By default, all your running programs are put in to the "Normal/Default Performance Category".
    You can choose to isolate any process to the "High Performance Category".
    Or you can choose to customize it fully with the "Custom Performance Category".
    You can have PACT ignore a process by including it in the Blacklist also, if it's giving you trouble (looking at you EAC).
    
These tiers, by default, all bind to all cores/threads at first.
You need to configure your Normal/DefaultPerformance and your High Performance categories.
