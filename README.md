# PACT
PACT is a free library and a tool that allows you to section off different processes in to different cores/threads on your CPU automagically.

It's default mode of operation allows you to pick your "Default Cores" and process priority.
All accessible processes run on those cores and on that priority setting.

You can also set your "High Performance Cores" and priority, you can then mark certain processes as High Performance and have them run on those cores with that priority.

For special occasions you can choose to tag some process as "Custom Performance" with custom CPU/Thread configuration and priority, exempt from the High Performance and Default configurations.

There is also a blacklist option, to ignore processes that don't play with PACT too well.

PACT can also detect games launched via Steam, Origin, GoG Galaxy, UPlay and more (or anything you want) and apply temporary "High Priority Status" to them.

#### PACT is free and under the MIT License.
